I updated the old library from Peter Wu: https://github.com/Lekensteyn/el4000

1. Only one file, simple to use and edit.
2. Works directly in the IDE.
3. Directly plots the result as an interactive plot, which is far more usefull than e.g. Excel, since you can "zoom in" and move around in the data as you wish.
